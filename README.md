# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit:

### A Colorado Board of Elections employee requested help with auditing the results of a local congressional election.  He requested the following information:
1.	Calculate the total number of votes that were cast.
2.	Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3.	Calculate the total number of votes each of the candidates received.
4.	Calculate the percentage of votes each of the candidates won.
5.	Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## Election Audit Results: 
A total of 369,711 votes were cast in the election.

The candidates were:
-	Charles Casper Stockham
-	Diana DeGette
-	Raymon Anthony Doane

The results for each of the candidates were:
-	Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the total with 85,213 votes.
-	Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the total with 272,892 votes. 
-	Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the total with 11,606 votes.

### The winner of the election was Diana DeGette who received 272,892 votes, which represented 73.8% of the total votes cast in the election.

## Challenge Overview

### After providing the election commission with the preliminary election results, they requested additional information about the election.  The commission requested:
1.	The voter turnout for each county.
2.	The percentage of votes each county contributed to the total election.
3.	To determine the county with the highest turnout.

## Challenge Summary

Total Votes = 369,711

-	Jefferson = 10.5% with 38,855 votes cast
-	Denver = 82.8% with 306.055 votes cast 
-	Arapahoe = 6.7% with 24,801 votes cast

## Election Audit Summary:

We enjoyed collaborating with you on this project and are glad of the successful completion.  We are wondering if the election commission would consider a proposal to fund the cost of making a couple of adjustments to the code to gain a tool with expanded capabilities?  
One modification that could be made to expand the use of it is to add the electoral vote weights to the county data to include it in the calculation.  Another example is to add the precinct information to the data.  These two changes would expand the use of the code to almost any election.  It would also allow for a more detailed analysis with the ability to identify trends of and shifts in the voting population at the local level.
